# That SOCs

Spiritual successor to my old project [siem_osint_automation](https://github.com/NicholasChua/siem_osint_automation) enhanced with more modularity, logging, and better coding practices.

## Planned Workflow

`That SOCs` currently covers the `Logging`, `IOC Extraction`, `Threat Intelligence Retrieval`, `Normalization`, `Enrichment` stages of the below planned workflow:

- **Alert Retrieval**: Fetches open (unassigned) security alerts from specified sources.
- **IOC Extraction**: Extracts Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from the alerts.
- **Threat Intelligence Retrieval**: Queries threat intelligence sources for information related to the extracted IOCs.
- **Normalization**: Standardizes the retrieved threat intelligence data into a consistent format.
- **Enrichment**: Augments the original alerts with the normalized threat intelligence data.
- **Alert Update**: Updates the status of the alerts based on the investigation results.
- **Logging**: Logs all activities for auditing and debugging purposes.

## Requirements

This project was tested on Python 3.14.2.

- Python 3 (latest version recommended)
- VirusTotal API key (free tier is sufficient)
- ipinfo.io API key (free tier is sufficient)
- AbuseIPDB API key (free tier is sufficient)
- AlienVault OTX API key (free tier is sufficient)
- .env file containing API keys

## How to Get API Keys

### .env File Setup

**`Warning`**: Do not share, upload, commit, or otherwise expose your API keys to the public. This can lead to unauthorized access and usage of your API keys. The `.env` file is used to store your API keys in a secure manner, and has been added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental exposure.

1. Copy the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. It should be in the root directory of the project with the following format:

```text
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=YOUR VIRUSTOTAL API KEY
IPINFO_API_KEY=YOUR IPINFO API KEY
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=YOUR ABUSEIPDB API KEY
ALIENVAULT_API_KEY=YOUR ALIENVAULT API KEY
```

2. Replace `YOUR VIRUSTOTAL API KEY`, `YOUR IPINFO API KEY`, `YOUR ABUSEIPDB API KEY`, `YOUR ALIENVAULT API KEY` with the respective API keys you obtained in the previous steps.

3. Ensure that the `.env` file is in the root directory of the project.

## Quick Start

1. Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure your `.env` file is set up with the necessary API keys as described in [`.env File Setup`](#env-file-setup) section.

3. Run main.py to execute the example workflow. Edit the file to modify the example IOCs as needed or parts of the workflow you want to test.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are provided in the `tests/` directory. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```
